EmailUI
=======

EmailUI was a project I completed during my time as a student research assistant to the University of North Carolina.

It is a mock web interface that simulates the Gmail client application to serv as a test framework for measuring the usability
of contact recommendation interfaces. The application tracks and logs all user actions including hovering, clicking, and typing. 

The main feature of the EmailUI is the ability to feed it arbitrary testing scenarios using a simple configuration file and a couple json files.
